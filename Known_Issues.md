### Known Issue and quick solving
 
 
## Videos in the gallery are not seen correctly

You can watch the videos correctly by installing the UTmedia application.
To see the video just start the application, click on "Select File", choose Gallery, select the video to view and confirm by clicking the top "v" button


## When I try to record a video, the camera freezes

Sometimes you can solve this problem by simply flip camera to front and after that back to back camera, so start to record.


## I think my phone has a battery drain

This problem can occur for several reasons.
The most common and obvious problem happens when mobile data is activated. This problem is given by the push notifications that can be disabled by typing the command "stop ubuntu-push-client" on the terminal. This command must be executed every time the phone is started.

Another common reason is how to charge the phone, it seems that by charging the phone turned off, the battery lasts longer.

Last possible solution related only to the Nexus 5 is that turning off the automatic rotation and rebooting the phone, the battery should be more.


## The data connection does not work on my Nexus 5

To solve this problem it is possible to change the release channel, if you are on the stable channel, you have to go to the devel channel and then back to stable. Instead if you are already on the devel channel you can switch to rc channel and then return to devel
