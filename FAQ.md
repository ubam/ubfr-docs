## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 What is Ubuntu Touch?

Ubuntu Touch is the touch-friendly mobile version of the popular Ubuntu operating system. Originally designed and developed by Canonical Ltd, the project now resides with the UBports Foundation.

The Ubuntu operating system, upon which Ubuntu Touch is based, is one of the most popular GNU/Linux distributions in the world. UBports is the new home for Ubuntu Touch and will continue with Canonical's original mission of Convergence — the bold idea of bringing mobile computing to the desktop and desktop computing to mobile which will now be developed by the UBports Foundation.

The goal of Convergence will be to seamlessly blend mobile and desktop environments into a single unified experience. UBports Foundation is excited to continue development of Ubuntu Touch and to bring Convergence to life.

### 1.2 Who is developing Ubuntu Touch?
    
An amazing team of coders, developers, testers and users from around the world working together to successfully advance the Ubuntu Touch project. Officially, the UBports Foundation will be the legal entity encompassing the project, but it is the community of volunteers that make Ubuntu Touch what it is today. If it were not for this community of dedicated individuals who've spent countless hours, and many sleepless nights, working on the project, we would not have the dream of Convergence and the Ubuntu Touch experience that everyone knows and loves.

### 1.3 What sets Ubuntu Touch apart from Apple and Android?
    
Ubuntu Touch has something no other mobile device has. Convergence — One platform for phone, tablet and desktop. Users will experience the freedom of chosing any device they desire by having a unified operatin system. Application developers create programs once, and they are automatically adjusted for optimal use dependent on the user and device. Desktop apps can run on the phone, and phone apps can run on the desktop... with only one app! The possibilities are exiciting and the future of computing is Convergence!

### 1.4 Convergence... what is it and how does it work?

Canonical started with Ubuntu Touch. Convergence was a dream and now it's reality on the Nexus 5!

- What is convergence?

Convergence is a single user experience that spans to all form factors and adapts to the different contexts of use. It means exactly the same operating system and applications run on phones, tablets and desktops. This is done by using responsive layouts that adapt to the different screen or window sizes.

Convergence supports all input types equally and simultaneously to allow users to interact using a pointer, touch or keyboard; whenever and however they choose.

- Why did we put priority on convergence?

Over the last twenty years computing has become exponentially faster, cheaper and more power efficient. As a result, phones and tablets today have the processing power to undertake tasks that only a few years ago required PC hardware. The boundaries between form factors are becoming blurred; there is very little difference in terms of hardware between an ultrabook with a touchscreen and a 12in tablet with a keyboard attached.

By using convergence we breakdown the last barrier between form factors with a single operating system and app ecosystem for all different types of hardware. This enables new forms of interaction. For example, drafting an email on your phone during your journey to work, and then when you arrive at your desk you can plug the phone into a monitor and continue composing the same email in a desktop environment.

- How does it work?

Its simple.  By attaching your Ubuntu Touch mobile device to a screen and pairing a bluetooth keyboard/mouse, you will enter the world of convergence and begin to understand what has us so excited.  With convergence, the future is mobile!

### 1.5 What is UBports?

UBports is the foundation/legal entity that stands behind projects like Ubuntu Touch. The UBports project was founded by Marius Gripsgard in 2015 and the programming source code for the project was, thanks to the hard work of many volunteers, picked up and moved into the free software community where the project could not only be maintained but also expanded. 

### 1.6 What is the UBports Foundation?

We are happy to say that we've collected the required members to file the paperwork to raise the UBports Foundation. This is an important step forward in the process. Our goal is still to have the Foundation ready for the beginning of next year.

The UBports Foundation's mission is to support the collaborative development of Ubuntu Touch and to promote the widespread use of Ubuntu Touch. It will give users a body to trust in the development of Ubuntu Touch. It will also improve our transparency in funding, spending, and decision making.

To learn more, check out the [UBports Foundation](https://www.ubports.com/page/foundation). 


Our goals:

- Help and promote the collaborative software development of Ubuntu Touch; 

- Encourage the development of Ubuntu Touch and its features while coordinating and organizing the collaborative work on the software; 

- Assist the community while defending its interests and the sustainability of its developments; 

- Promote the use of the Ubuntu Touch as solution for mobile devices; 

- Facilitate synergies, collaborations and fund raising efforts; 

- Actively collaborate on the definition of the roadmaps of new versions, features and their implementation.







## 2.0 {16.04} ... Here we come!!

### 2.1 Which devices will be supported by the 16.04 branch?

From our recent developments of Project Sudoku, we've been able to change how we will handle our policy for the Legacy phones. In our original plan to bring our platform to 16.04, we were using systemd, which requires changes to a device's kernel to use versus Upstart. With Sudoku, we are continuing to use Upstart. This means that we can bring 16.04 to all of our currently supported devices.

We have begun creating 16.04 images for all supported devices. It is currently only for use by developers and testers and we welcome your [contributions](https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/contribute/quality-assurance.html).



### 2.2 Why not skip 16.04 and go directly to 18.04?

An excellent question. Going from 15.04 to 16.04 isn't easy, but it seems to be much easier than going from 15.04 to the (very early) 18.04. Similarly, rebuilding 15.04 sources on a 16.04 base isn't easy, but it is faster. Choosing the easier path means a faster release, which means we don't get left in the dust. Release early, release often.


### 2.3 What is the most recent version?

The most stable version available for the core devices (Nexus5, Fairphone 2 and Oneplus One) is 15.04. Soon 16.04 LTS will be released for these devices. The next version, 16.04 LTS, is under active heavy development and will be released shortly. For developers and testers interested in working on [16.04](https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/contribute/quality-assurance.html).


If you would like to follow along with the development of 16.04, see our [progress](https://github.com/ubports/ubuntu-touch/milestone/8).


### 2.4 When will I be able to re-flash my phone with new 16.04 images?

We're working as fast as we can to get the images out there but currently do not have fixed dates. The Halium project is expected to signifcantly speed this process up. To track our progress, you can follow along at [here](https://github.com/ubports/ubuntu-touch/milestone/8).

With the success of Halium, our release time frame is expected to be significantly reduced and we will be able to push out new images much quicker. The Halium project will unify the Hardware Abstraction Layer and create a bridge between Android hardware and the Ubuntu Touch operating system. With a successful Halium project, UBports team will spend less time on Android device drivers and more time on Ubuntu Touch. That is what we like to call a Win–Win.




## 3.0 General Questions:

### 3.1 Hello there. I am new to UT and just looking around, trying to understand the system and how I might be able to help...

We need you!  UBports is a welcoming community of like minded individuals interested in promoting Ubuntu Touch. If you are interested in Ubuntu Touch we would love to have you. Please vist our [Get Involved](https://ubports.com/page/get-involved) and [Welcome](https://ubports.com/page/telegram-welcome) pages to find out more about Ubuntu Touch.


### 3.2 Does Ubuntu Touch work in my country?

   Ubuntu Touch works everywhere: Underwater, In space, or even in Canada. Your connectivity will depend on the device hardware and networks available in those locations though. Please see [devices](https://ubports.com/page/devices) page for more information about frequency compatibility.


### 3.3 Which device is the best to give Ubuntu Touch a try?

The Nexus 5, Fairphone 2 and Oneplus One offer the best experience and are used by many people as their *Daily Drivers*.


### 3.4 What are the Core Devices?

Core Devices are the Devices that will recieve all the new features, critical security-updates and bug-fixes from UBports. These devices will soon be rebased on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Until then, the existing legacy image (based on 15.04) can be installed.

   - One Plus One

   - Fairphone 2

   - Nexus 5

   - Optimus L90

   - BQ M10 HD

   - BQ M10 FHD


To find our most curent and up to date list of [devices](https://devices.ubports.com/#/)


### 3.5 Will you build on the foundation provided by Canonical?

Yes! UBports will take over all devices and will continue delivering new features for the core devices. The older legacy devices will be maintained on life support and the actual work will happen in the non-legacy branch, but we will still provide critical security-updates and merge bug-fixes from the community. This way you will still be able to use your phone with Ubuntu Touch if you own one of the official devices, but the cool and shiny new features will probably only land in the non-legacy branch.


Due to the limitations of the closed Android device trees on the official BQ and Meizu products, we have no choice but to relegate them to the legacy branch. Without access to the device tree, this prevents us from fixing bugs in hardware enablement or adding new features dependent on the kernel.


### 3.6 Does UBports guarantee support for Ubuntu Touch?

Like everyone else, although we cannot be held legally liable for any problems that happen with the devices, we will always work diligently to resolve any issues as quickly as possible, should they arise. Just like you, we are passionate about every device working as smoothly as possible and we look forward to you helping us accomplish this.


### 3.7 Why does Ubuntu Touch use the Android kernel?

We rely on Android kernel and drivers to make the phone work. This is the unfortunate reality of Android hardware.


### 3.8 What license does Ubuntu Touch use?

Ubuntu operates under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and all of the application software installed by default is free software. In addition, Ubuntu installs some hardware drivers that are available only in binary format, but such packages are clearly marked in the restricted component.

                
### 3.9 How can I access the 3G/4G network on the device?

It should just work, if for some reason it doesn't verify that your mobile broadband provider is part of /usr/share/mobile-broadband-provider-info/serviceproviders.xml.


### 3.10 With all this talk of Librem 5, Purism's new phone, can I install Ubuntu Touch on it?

Great question. We are excited about the Librem 5 phone and think it might be a great new Ubuntu Touch device. Time will tell what the final device will look like and we will analyze its capabilities as a future Ubuntu Touch device once the details are finalized.


### 3.11 Which applications run on Ubuntu Touch?

There are many applications in the [OpenStore](http://open.uappexplorer.com) that run on Ubuntu Touch. Some popular applications include: Telegram messenger, uMatriks, Podbird (audio shows), Dekko2 (email), Instagraph (instagram) and uNav. However, many of the apps that you know on Android/iOS might not exist yet. There is a project called [Anbox](https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/userguide/dailyuse/anbox.html) that is working on allowing android apps to be run on Ubuntu Touch.

### 3.12 Anbox ...   The world of Android apps with the power and security of Ubuntu Touch!

Anbox puts the Android operating system into a container, abstracts hardware access and integrates core system services into a GNU/Linux system. Every Android application will be integrated with your operating system like any other native application. 

Installation instructions are now at [UBports Docs](https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/userguide/dailyuse/anbox.html)

It is to be noted that Anbox currently works only on select devices (listed in the docus) running 16.04. Thus, it is meant only for testing by experienced users in its current state. Neithe Anbox nor 16.04 are ready as a daily driver. Anbox requires a kernel change, which has not been completely tested yet. This is so that the "Android Binder" will work. Eventually there will be a "two-binder" system so that the Anbox and Ubuntu Touch parts don't interfere with each other.

Report any anbox issues [here](https://github.com/ubports/anbox/issues).

### 3.13 Where can I find apps for Ubuntu Touch?

In the OpenStore app running on Ubuntu Touch or browse online at the [uAppExlorer](https://open.uappexplorer.com/). The Ubuntu Store will be closing its doors at the end of 2017 and we will be working with developers to help migrate their apps over to the OpenStore.

### 3.14 Is there any documentation for Ubuntu Touch?

Our documentation can be found at our [Read The Docs](https://docs.ubports.com) page.

### 3.15 How can I stay informed about all that is happening with Ubuntu Touch?

A great place to chat and hang out with the community is our [Telegram](https://t.me/ubports) and [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ubports:matrix.org) groups.

Our [Community Updates](https://ubports.com/blog/community-updates-5) is the UBports channel which provides live updates directly from the lead developers about the current state of Ubuntu Touch.  It is usually a fun and entertaining way to find out exactly what is happening behind the scenes.  To find out when the next one will take place, follow us in [Telegram](https://t.me/ubports), check out the [forums](https://forums.ubports.com/) or subscribe to the [News Feed](https://t.me/ubports_news).

The Ubuntu Touch [Audiocast](https://ubports.com/blog/the-audiocasts-3) is a less technical focus that is light, educational, entertaining. 

And of course the [Forums](https://forums.ubports.com) for a more permanent record of all things technical.





## 4. OS Development

### 4.1 Where do I report Ubuntu Touch bugs?

Please start by contacting us in our [Telegram SuperGroup](https://t.me/ubports)

To report any bugs and issues with Ubuntu Touch, check out [Ubuntu Touch Issues](https://github.com/ubports/ubuntu-touch/issues) and search you device code name.  For proper documenting proecdures and further details on bug reporting, follow our [Issue Tracking Guidelines](https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/about/process/issue-tracking.html).


### 4.2 By far the thing that excites me the most about Ubuntu Touch is the prospect of Desktop mode, could you explain it in a bit more detail?

This new mode called Desktop mode, is what makes Ubuntu Touch so exciting and why the project has gained enormous support. This concept, following in the philosophy of Convergence, allows a mobile device to automatically transform into a desktop computer when attached to an external screen. Paired with a bluetooh keyboard and mouse, the phone will have all the capability of Ubuntu for desktop, but will be running from your mobile device. The possibilities are groundbreaking and we are excited to continue developing this feature and look forward to expanding the possibilities.

  
### 4.3 Will Ubuntu Touch have a desktop interface if plugged via HDMI cable or Slimport?

Yes, if your phone is capable you will be able to run Ubuntu Touch on it's touch screen, but then dock it to an external screen, and be presented with the Desktop shell. This is the power of Convergence which the UBports team is excited to bring to your mobile devices.


### 4.4 Is it possible to dual-boot with Android? (e.g. Multirom)

Multiboot is not fun to maintain and we don't have time to do it. Some people have been able to get this working with kernel patches and recovery tricks, but it will kill OTA updates. We plan for Anbox to solve the Android problem.

 
### 4.5 What are the minimum hardware requirements (processor, ram, storage, etc)?

Currently on the 15.04 codebase, the minimum specs for the Ubuntu Touch operating system are:

   - 1 Ghz dual core Cortext A9

   - 1 GB ram

   - OpenGL/ES supported graphics

   - 8 GB storage


### 4.6 How will Ubuntu Touch work with the new SNAP packages?

A snap is a self-contained package of libraries and runtimes that provide all the necessary ingredients to allow an application to run. This allow the snap to be confined from the OS and other apps through security mechanisms but still allow communication with other snaps according to policies defined by the user. In addition, users have the ability to upgrade/downgrade applicatinos without affecting the core OS or any other applications. This is game changing for GNU/Linux as it allows apps to be upgraded and modified worry free since it is possible to easily roll back to a previous state. Our goal is to support Snap packages on the M10 Tablets and Pro 5 device once the 16.04 update arrives. OS and Kernel patches will need modification and this is still a work in progress.


### 4.7 I am interested in learning programming for Ubuntu Touch, what is the best way to start and are there any courses?

UBports documentation is hosted [here](https://docs.ubports.com).

Community member Miguel has put together an amazing programming course.  All documentation can be found [here](https://www.gitbook.com/book/mimecar/ubuntu-touch-programming-course/details) as well as in the UBports [forum](https://forums.ubports.com/topic/184/ubuntu-touch-programming-course).


### 4.8 Who is developing the core OS functions?


   - Marius Gripsgard

   - Ricardo Mendoza 

   - Jan Sprinz

   - Florian Leeber

   - Dalton Durst

   - Ewald Pierre


### 4.9 Where can I get information on the "core packages"?

All of the required packages for the system are found in our [metapackage](https://github.com/ubports/ubuntu-touch-meta).


The packages we build are also in the [repo](http://repo.ubports.com/pool/xenial-7.1-caf/main/).


### 4.10 What are all the modules Ubuntu Touch is built from and who takes care of them?  (MIR, YUNIT, Core apps, OpenSTORE, ...)


### 4.11 Halium is a hardware abstraction layer right?

Halium is the collaborative project to unify the Hardware Abstraction Layer for projects which run GNU/Linux on mobile devices with pre-installed Android.  What this means is quicker development and lanches of Ubuntu Touch on halium based android devices.  None of our existing devices will run halium since it doesn't really make sense from a development stand point.  Ubuntu Touch is being [actively developed](https://github.com/ubports/ubuntu-touch/issues/404) to run on vanilla Halium but isn't ready yet.



### 4.12 Can you offer full disk encryption capabilities?

We don‘t have a GUI for this yet, but we should have the ability to encrypt the home folder using the terminal similar to how it‘s done on a regular install of Ubuntu.


### 4.13 How can one contribute to graphics and UX design?

There are multiple ways to present and offer them. Get in touch with us on [Telegram](https://t.me/ubports) or #ubports at Freenode to discuss.


You can also find information on our [Get Involved](https://www.ubports.com/page/get-involved) page.


If you wish to submit new designs via [github](https://github.com/ubports/ubuntu-touch/issues), you can start an issue and post images of your ideas.


### 4.14 How can I create a theme?

   Right now, you‘d do this by creating a UITK style, but we don‘t have terribly much information for this. It‘s possible that changes will come with 16.04, but we‘re not sure yet.
    
     
### 4.15 Why are apps not allowed to run in the background/when the phone is locked?

This was a design decision made by the developers at Canonical. The goal was to give Ubuntu Touch the longest possible battery life, sacrificing a bit of usability for it. For some apps there exists a special rule called lifecycle exception, and they are allowed to work in the background. For example the music player works with this exception. UBports is working on a concept that will relax these strict rules a bit for future releases.


### 4.16 How can I use an SD cards for extra storage?

The internal memory of your Ubuntu Touch device can be expanded using a microSD card as long as your device has the hardware to support it.  To begin using an SD card, simple insert it into your device until you hear a click which indicates its been inserted correctly.  To remove the card, safely unmount the card using the External Drives app, then press in on the card to eject it.

### 4.17 Have you considered a hotfix release to fix (issue x)?

Yes, we have considered it. We have decided that we will not offer hotfix releases unless an issue is both a regression and critically damages use of the phone. For example, if the radio on every Nexus 5 broke with a stable update, we would release a hotfix.


Other than that, we want to stick to our 6-8 week schedule of OTAs.


### 4.18 What is Ubuntu for Android and how does it work with Ubuntu Touch?

Ubuntu Touch is the operating system that runs on the bare metal, so to speak, of the phone and is developed and maintained by UBports. Our software is designed to completely wipe off android, except for the bits to control camera, modem, gps, etc, and install a totally new and advanced OS.


Ubuntu for Android is an app created by Canonical for Android devices. The two projects are not related.


### 4.19 Will the ARMv6 architecture be supported?

Ubuntu Touch currently targets the ARMv7 and above Appliaction Processor family (Cortex A8, A9 and above).





## 5. Installation & Porting

### 5.1 Where can I chat about and possibly getting help installing Ubuntu Touch?

We invite you to join our [Newcomers Room](https://t.me/WelcomePlus) where all of the friendly UBports Welcoming Team are ready to help. This is a special area to not only help with installation questions, but also to introduce yourself and get to know some other community members outside our main Supergroup. We understand that with 1000 members strong, you may not feel comfortable jumping right in, so we created a side area for introductions. If you would like to join the Ubuntu Touch community this is a great place to start.


## 5.2 How do I install Ubuntu Touch on my device? 
   
If you have one of our supporeted devices, please see our [Get Ubuntu Touch](https://ubports.com/page/get-ubuntu-touch) page.

 
## 5.3 Will you port to my device, which is not currently in the core devices or legacy devices list?

Due to limited time and resources, we are not porting to new devices until the 16.04 rebase is finished.

[Devices](https://ubports.com/page/devices) provides of list of our supported phones and tablets.

If you should want to get involved in porting, our [documentation](https://docs.ubports.com) provides further information.


## 5.4 How does the Ubuntu Installer work?

[Ubuntu Installer](https://github.com/ubports/ubports-installer) is simple and easy to use.

Launch the downloaded AppImage and follow the instructions. Its that easy. Please [contact us](https://t.me/WelcomePlus) and let us know how it went!


## 5.5 I've heard about this Magic-Device-Tool, what is it and how does it work?

Ubuntu Touch will now use the Ubuntu Installer instead of the MDT.

MDT tool can be found [here](https://github.com/MariusQuabeck/magic-device-tool).

## 5.6 What is ADB for and why do I need it?

In simple terms, adb is a way for your desktop computer and device to communitcate with each other through a USB cable. It is a tool that comes with android-tools-adb and android-tools-fastboot which is used by the Ubuntu Touch installer on a supported device. 

If you are on Ubuntu 16.04 desktop computer, type the following commands in termainl:
`sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot phablet-tools`


## 5.7 I've heard about a CPT installer, what is it?

It is an older installer that was a temporarly solution when UBports started, and is now being phased out and will be replaced by the UBports-Installer.

## 5.8 How do I install Ubuntu Touch on my laptop/desktop?

Our primary focus is on Ubuntu Touch for mobile phones and tablets at the moment. We have not yet produced an x86 build of Ubuntu Touch but compatiility will be provided later to support the converged device use case.





## 6. Translation

### 6.1 Who do I contact and where do I go if I am interested in helping in the area of languages and translation?

Please join and get in touch with someone in our UBlangs [Telegram](https://t.me/ubports) group to find out more.

### 6.2 What is UBlangs and who is in charge of naming?

UBlangs is our telegram group devoted to translating Ubuntu Touch and the applications that run on it.  

Our [Welcome Page](https://ubports.com/page/telegram-welcome) has a list of current Telegram language groups.  If you don't see your language listed, please contact us to see about setting it up.


   


## 7. Application Development

### 7.1 Where can I find apps for Ubuntu Touch?

On any device running Ubuntu Touch you can check out the OpenStore app to see all the apps available in the official UBports store. To browse the collection from a desktop comptuer, please see [uAppExplorer](http://open.uappexplorer.com) for a current list of available apps.


### 7.2 Does Ubuntu Touch support Android apps?

Yes we do!  We are happy to announce that [Anbox](https://anbox.io) is now available on our 16.04 Ubuntu Touch builds.  


### 7.3 Does Ubuntu Touch support Desktop applications?

   We would like a lot more X11 apps to be avaible on Xenial. Xmir will make this a lot easier. The Libertine container was difficult to worth with, but we want it to work.


### 7.4 How can I create apps using Clickable?

Check out our [documentation](https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/) for information on creating apps.

Brian Douglas has created [Clickable](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable) to compile, build, and deploy Ubuntu Touch click packages all from the command line.

### 7.5 Will all apps be migrated from the Canonical store to the OpenStore?

We've taken a fairly conservative stance on moving apps wholesale from the Canonical store into the OpenStore. We don't want to be stuck with a ton of apps that will never have any hope of being maintained again. Instead, we've been contacting and encouraging developers to move their apps on their own accord.


If you have any app that you just can't live without and the developer hasn't moved it yet, we encourage you to let them know that you love their app and want to see it continue.


### 7.6 Is it possible to setup Linuxbrew and install formulae?

[Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh/) will provide more information.

- Features
   - Can install software to a home directory and so does not require sudo
   - Install software not packaged by the native distribution
   - Install up-to-date versions of software when the native distribution is old
   - Use the same package manager to manage both your Mac and GNU/Linux machines


### 7.7 Can I use the APT repositories on Ubuntu Touch and install packages?

Our goal is to provide a single platform for app developers, which will allow a single codebase to run on all Ubuntu Touch devices. It is possible to use `apt` on your Ubuntu Touch device but it is only for developers as it will most certainly break future ota updates.




### 8. Other

## 8.1 How do you "say" UBports? How do you say Ubuntu?

   OK, so if you watched any of the [YouTube live shows](https://ubports.com/blog/community-updates-5), then you know what this is about!

   UBports is pronounced "You Be Ports" and Ubuntu is pronounced "Ooh boon too". UBports is not plural, never remove the S from the end.








# 9. POSSIBLE FAQ IDEAS

##What is Project Sudoku?

Project Sudoku is our latest plan to fast-track the development of an image based on Ubuntu 16.04. It involves taking a majority of the Unity 8 / Mir source that is running right now on 15.04 and rebuilding it on 16.04. Easy, right?

Actually, it seems like this will be much easier than continuing all of the conversion work from the final Unity 8 sources back to phones. At the end of Unity's life inside Canonical, the convergence vision was (mostly) dropped in the hope of bringing it to market faster. This included some work to convert Upstart scripts to SystemD units, rewriting slow QML modules in C++, and some other extremely thoughtful and useful additions. Unfortunately, none of this work was completed and we're left with something that's... half baked. Marius sent me a picture of two people walking up some stairs and then falling back down to illustrate the difficulty of making Xenial work.

By going back to 15.04 sources, we forego all of the improvements, but also all of the hardship of completing these conversions. This is definitely a huge compromise, but one that we hope can get ourselves on a more stable, updated, and secure base OS.

Sudoku refers to the idea that we need to take parts and ideas from everywhere we can to complete the puzzle that is Ubuntu Touch. It's also a prime example of why you don't let developers name things.

## How can I view, edit or create Office Documents? (without libertine please)

## Something about Cloud Storage????  integration with NextCloud?????


## How can I backup my phone?

  SSH and/or MDT?



## Do you have the official Ubuntu Touch documentation? (needs more information)

Yes, it's all on GitHub. Assuming you mean the documentation on docs.ubuntu.com.


## Will you relax app confinement?

App developers would love it if we did, but the security minded among us take pause at the idea of completely relaxing confinement. We'll have to strike a balance between the two.


## What will you do with scopes?

This is a meritocratic community. If the people contributing (especially app developers) want scopes to stay in the OS and develop compelling options for the platform, they stay. As it is, though, there is a very interesting (working) home screen concept that takes the best of the aggregation scopes like Today and puts them right in front of you. Since it's working, it has a lot of weight in our decision making process.

If you have an idea for an overhaul to Scopes and can get the support from others to get it developed, we'd love to see it.


## Halium

(Developer content ahead!) As for the Halium news for this week, Marius has managed to get 15.04 images somewhat working on Halium. The largest issue is that Mir doesn't run, which requires some patching to libhybris. Someone in the community has compared the differences between upstream libhybris and Canonical's fork to provide a patch that should add the required Mir support. Another issue that Halium is running into is not working correctly on devices that come with Qualcomm's modified version of Android, known officially as "Android for MSM" and unofficially as CAF. Running Halium on these devices requires a rebuild of libhybris, as well as any OS components that directly interface with it. In our case, that's Mir



## Who do you have in mind when delevoping Ubuntu Touch?


## What will this FAQ tell me? / What do I do if it doesn't tell me what I want?


## So, is this like a Linux phone?
              
##What works on ______ device? (I think we need video demos of each device, updated every OTA if not sooner) — i.e. This is what you're getting yourself into (enter youtube... some wanabe star usually does this for us — hopefully someone IN the procject rather than)

##Why is UBports using Telegram when other messaging apps are more secure?
              


## Where can I send my feedback on 

   please see our Contact page at https://ubports.com/page/contactus

    -  


## Will the final product allow me to us "sudo" and "apt-get" just like a desktop computer?

    I'm not sure we want to get this technical with the faqs.  Focus on new users? Terminal commands are generally not for "normal" people. 






======================================



# 10. Removed Questions

### 2.1 Why won't all Canonical devices get an upgrade to the new 16.04 base?      
          
The simple answer is that we cannot upgrade these devices because their Android source tree is closed and there is no *official* Lineage OS port available. This can be broken down into *more* explanation!

a) Why do you need Android at all? Aren't you making a GNU/Linux distribution?

This is the unfortunate reality of Android hardware. There is no BIOS or UEFI to start up all the bits and pieces of a device. There aren't standard ways to access hardware. To be perfectly honest, it's a complete mess. It's the mess that we live in, though. 

Android drivers are written for Android and nothing else. A regular GNU/Linux distro has no way to use these drivers as they speak completely different languages. Because of this, we need to run a small copy of Android to translate between Android drivers and the language that GNU/Linux speaks. This is provided by Halium.

In order to build Halium for a single device, we need to have all of the source and configuration that goes into that device. This brings up our next problem.

Closed Android Source Tree

Most of Android is licensed under the Apache license, so there is no need for a device manufacturer to provide this code and configuration to the world. BQ and Meizu chose not to provide this source code except to their partners. This choice is within their rights.


"But wait," we hear you say. "Here's a GitHub link to the kernel source of *device X*. Now you can port to it!"

A device kernel must always be open source due to the copyleft nature of the GPL. That's not all of Android, though. There's another ~20GB of source code that gets compiled into our hardware compatibility layer.

Sometimes, though, the Lineage OS community is able to put everything together and release their OS to a closed source device. This can lead to our third problem.


Official Lineage OS Ports

For now, official ports of Halium are based on official ports of Lineage OS. This is because we want to provide the most reliable experience for developers. An unofficial port of Lineage OS (or Resurrection Remix, or one of the other hundreds of Android ROMs) can have issues in drivers that cripple development before it even begins. We don't have the time or manpower to deal with these issues. Porting to devices is difficult enough as it is.


Of course, we will always accept community help getting moforre devices ported. The Nexus 4 port is community-maintained, for example. We simply will not take that work on ourselves right now.

We hope this better explains our position on the official Canonical devices.


### 4.8 What about push notifications after Canonical will stop their services?

   Canonical did not announce when their push server will go offline, but we expect it to happen end of 2017. Currently only Telegram seems to use the push server. They offered us to continue sending push notifications to a server in our infrastructure, and we are working on the details. Depending on the progress however it could be that push notifications will be unavailable for some time. We know that Telegram notifications are essential and take this very serious, but we also need to make sure that the service is secure and reliable.


   UBports is working on upgrading the push servers and we expect to launch the new server towards the end of 2017. At the moment, Telegram is the only app that is utilizing this service. Push notifications are essential and it is a priority to maintain a secure and reliable network.
