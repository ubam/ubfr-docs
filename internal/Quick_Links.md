## WELCOME ROOM BOT SCRIPT

Hi $username! I'm the welcome bot to the UBports Welcome Room. Thanks for dropping by!

This group is where you get all your first questions answered and meet a few new people. Because this is a 'drop in' room, be sure to 'leave' the room when you are finished or ask someone to help you â€” but feel free to jump in again at any point as you need.

If you haven't already, be sure to check out all the useful links at https://ubports.com/page/telegram-welcome.

Thanks again for dropping by the Welcome Room and someone will be with you shortly. ðŸ˜€

WELCOME ROOM GOODBYE SCRIPT

Thanks again for dropping into the Welcome Room, $username, and don't forget you can drop by again later if you need. See you in the Super Group! ðŸ˜€





## WELCOME ROOM PURGE ANNOUNCEMENT

Good day and great news!

Today is International Purging Day in the UBports Welcome Room!

As explained by our friendly Welcome Bot when you arrived, the Welcome Room is designed for people to come in and out of as they need.  

Sometimes people get busy and forget to exit after their discussions are finished and their Telegram gets noisy with Welcome Room stuff.

On International Purging Day, we fix that problem for you - for free - by kicking everyone out!
Picture it like a group of excited people rushing into a concert - except this time you are rushing out!

After you are purged always feel free to come back to get the help you need.

... and don't forget that we are a bunch of volunteers and if you feel like you could be a Welcome Room Captain, don't hesitate to reach out to a UBFR member today to discuss.

Final note
If you are not part of the main English supergroup - you should be.  Here is the link: https://t.me/ubports
If you are not subscribed to the News Channel - you should be.  Here is the link:  https://t.me/ubports_news

Have a nice day and enjoy the purging!

Hi $name

Welcome to the UBports Supergroup!  Here are some tools I thought you should have:

- Most of your basic answers can be found at www.ubports.com, so please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our â€˜hubâ€™ specifially:
   1. Our Community Update channel: a more technical focus. It is live and unscripted (maybe) so hilarity is sure to ensue. https://ubports.com/blog/community-updates-5
   2. The Ubuntu Touch Audiocast: a less technical focus that is light, educational, entertaining. https://ubports.com/blog/the-audiocasts-3
- Some of the most common questions that you will have are already answered on our FAQ page, so absolutely take a quick trip there right away: https://ubports.com/page/frequently-asked-questions.
- For a more permanent record of all things technical, the Forums can be found at https://forums.ubports.com/
- Looking for a way to participate in the community (ie. development/marketing) or in any way? Let me know and Iâ€™ll do my best to help you get where you need to go.

UBports is a great community of users and developers.  Please let me know if you need further assistance and I'll do what I can.
Thanks
